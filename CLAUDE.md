## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # Next.js dev server :3000 (Turbopack)
npm run build        # Production build (Webpack — Turbopack prod not stable)
npm start            # Serve production build
npm run lint         # ESLint check
npm run format:check # Prettier check
npm run test:unit    # Node test runner (backend) + Vitest (frontend)
npm run test:integration
npm run test:api     # Requires running server + Atlas
npm run test:e2e     # Playwright Chromium; requires running server
```

Git hooks live in `.githooks/` (`core.hooksPath`, wired via the `prepare` script on `npm install`). `pre-push` runs lint + format:check only — no tests — so CI's `test-unit`/`test-integration`/`test-api`/`e2e` chain still needs `lint` and `audit` to pass (see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`); skip a one-off push guard with `git push --no-verify`.

## Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`. Key vars:

```
JWT_SECRET / JWT_EXPIRES_IN
MONGODB_URI          # Atlas drive-ledger database (auto-created on first write)
FRONTEND_URL         # Used in password-reset email links (= BASE_URL in prod)
RESEND_API_KEY       # Resend email API
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID / NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID
SENTRY_DSN / NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN / SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN
BOTID_ENABLED / NEXT_PUBLIC_BOTID_ENABLED  # opt-in Vercel BotID gate on login/register
DPO_CONTACT          # LGPD contact shown by GET /api/auth/me/access; falls back to a placeholder if unset
TRUSTED_PROXY        # 'true' if self-hosting behind a reverse proxy that overwrites X-Forwarded-For; see Auth hardening
```

`SENTRY_DSN` server-only; `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` client + server — both must be set in Vercel.

## Architecture

Next.js 16 App Router — single repo, API routes + frontend, deployed on Vercel Fluid Compute.

- `app/api/` — Route Handlers. `withAuth(handler)` in `lib/auth.mjs` decodes JWT and passes `user` as 3rd arg (`NextRequest` is immutable). It also calls `connectDB()` itself (needed for the `tokenVersion` check — see Auth hardening below) before the handler's own `connectDB()` call runs.
- `lib/services/` — all business logic. Errors thrown with `.status`; handlers read `err.status || 500`.
- `lib/db.mjs` — `connectDB()` called at top of every Route Handler; uses `globalThis._mongoose` cache.
- `views/` — page-level components (renamed from `pages/` to avoid Pages Router conflict).
- All page/component files are `'use client'` — JWT in localStorage requires client-side auth.

Error convention: `makeError(status, message)` → `Error` with `.status` field. Route Handler catch blocks call `errorResponse(err, { route })` from `lib/handlerResponse.mjs` — it masks the message as `'Internal server error'` for 5xx (Mongoose/driver/Stripe/Resend internals never reach the client) while still reporting the real exception to Sentry via `reportHandlerError`; 4xx messages pass through unchanged since they're intentional and mapped in `i18n/apiErrors.js`. Built on the global `Response`, not `NextResponse` — keeps the helper importable under plain `node --test` (`next/server` only resolves under Next's own bundler).

Sentry gotcha: `instrumentation.js` and `instrumentation-client.js` use CJS (`require`/`module.exports`) — ESM/CJS conflict with Turbopack. Webpack ESM rule in `next.config.mjs` handles prod build.

## Domain Rules

**Expenses — Fuel category**: requires `litres` + `price_per_litre`; `amount` is auto-computed (`litres × price_per_litre`, 2 dp). Passing `amount` → 400. PATCH ignores `amount` for Fuel. `date` must not be future.

**Reminders**: at least one of `dueDate` or `dueKm` required. Status: `overdue` (past dueDate OR currentKm ≥ dueKm), `dueSoon` (within 7 days / 500 km), `upcoming` (else). Completion with `intervalMonths`/`intervalKm` auto-creates the next reminder.

**Odometer**: `Fuel` expense with `odometer` field updates `user.currentKm`. Drives km-based reminder status.

**Income (Pro feature)**: every entry point in `lib/services/income.service.js` — `createIncome`, `listIncome`, `getProfitSummary`, `getIncome`, `updateIncome`, `deleteIncome` — calls `assertProPlan(userId, 'income_feature_locked')` (`lib/planGate.js`) first, so a user downgraded off Pro loses read access to existing rows too, not just writes. `deleteAllByUser` (account deletion) is intentionally ungated. `income_feature_locked` is mapped in `i18n/apiErrors.js`.

**Auth hardening** (password path, alongside Google): password sign-in stays for non-Google users, hardened:

- **Rate limiting** (`lib/middleware/rateLimit.js` + `lib/models/rateLimit.model.js`): Mongo-backed, not `globalThis` — required so limits hold across Vercel Fluid Compute instances. `withRateLimitedHandler` is async now; the 4 password routes + `/google` + `/resend-verification` call `connectDB()` **before** the rate-limited handler (limiter needs Mongo, and calling it after would hang on a cold instance). `clientIp()` only trusts `X-Forwarded-For` when `VERCEL === '1'` or `TRUSTED_PROXY=true` — Vercel's edge always overwrites the header, but off-Vercel it's fully client-controlled otherwise. Untrusted ⇒ `null` IP, which is fail-**open** (same bucket as a header-less request today), not fail-closed — CI's proxy-less `next start` would otherwise be rate-limited into failure. `lib/validateEnv.js` warns at boot when neither condition holds, since IP-based limiting is silently inert in that case.
- **Account lockout** (`lib/services/auth.service.js`): 5 consecutive bad passwords locks the account with exponential backoff (1m→1h, capped). Locked-out login still returns the generic `401 Invalid credentials` — never reveals the lock state.
- **Password strength + breach check** (`lib/services/passwordPolicy.js`): zxcvbn score ≥2 (not ≥3 — would defeat the existing 8-char minimum) + HaveIBeenPwned k-anonymity range check, fail-open on network error. Runs on register/changePassword/resetPassword, after existing length/format/duplicate checks.
- **Register email enumeration**: duplicate **email** returns the same generic success (no account created, notifies the existing address via `sendAccountExistsEmail`) instead of 409 — email is the sensitive identifier. Duplicate **username** still 409 (a deliberately public handle).
- **Vercel BotID**: `checkBotId()` gate on login/register, opt-in via `BOTID_ENABLED`/`NEXT_PUBLIC_BOTID_ENABLED` — off by default so CI (`next build && next start`, no real Vercel deployment) isn't blocked.
- **Session revocation** (`user.tokenVersion`, default 0): access tokens carry a `tv` claim set at issue time; `withAuth` (`lib/auth.mjs`) rejects a request when `tv` doesn't match the user's current `tokenVersion`, read from Mongo and cached per-instance for 5s (`TOKEN_VERSION_CACHE_TTL_MS`) so revocation isn't a DB read on every request — propagation lag is bounded by that TTL. `changePassword`/`resetPassword` (via `userModel.updatePassword`, which also clears any lockout) and `unlinkGoogle` all bump it, invalidating every previously-issued token immediately. `POST /api/auth/refresh-token` carries the original `oiat` (issued-at) claim forward across renewals — capped at 30 days from first login (`REFRESH_MAX_AGE_SECONDS`) — and refuses to refresh while the account is locked out. A token predating this field has no `tv`/`oiat` claim; both are treated as `0`/"now" so existing sessions keep working rather than being force-logged-out at deploy.
- **Password-reset tokens are single-use**: the reset JWT also carries `tv` at issue time; `resetPassword` compares it against the user's current `tokenVersion` (loaded by username) and rejects a mismatch with the same generic `401 Invalid or expired reset token` a bad/expired token gets. Since a successful reset bumps `tokenVersion`, the link dies the instant it's used — or if the password changes any other way first.

## Frontend

**HTTP layer**: all calls via `services/apiService.js` — never `fetch()` in components. To add an endpoint: export from `apiService.js` using the internal `request()` helper.

**Auth**: JWT in `localStorage['token']`. `AuthContext` decodes payload client-side (no `/me` call). 401/403 dispatches `window` event `'auth:logout'` → context clears token and redirects to `/login`.

**i18n**: `pt-BR` default, `en` supported. `localStorage['i18nextLng']` is the client source of truth; a mirrored `lang` cookie (`utils/languageCookie.js`) lets `app/layout.jsx` render SSR HTML in the right language on the first request — without it, SSR always rendered `pt-BR` while an `en` client hydrated in English, a hydration mismatch on every page. `I18nProvider` takes `initialLanguage` from that cookie, clones the i18n instance per-request on the server, and syncs the client singleton before hydration; a mount effect migrates legacy visitors (cookie missing, localStorage set) by writing the cookie once. JWT carries `language`; `AuthContext.login()` applies it (and writes the cookie) only if no localStorage key exists (client pref wins). `updateLanguage()` also writes the cookie. New backend error strings need a mapping in `i18n/apiErrors.js`.

**Modal pattern**: `.modal-backdrop` + `.modal` (global CSS). `ReminderStatusBadge` puts `data-testid` and `data-status` on the **same** element — E2E selector: `[data-testid="reminder-status-badge"][data-status="upcoming"]` (no space).

**`useSearchParams`** must be wrapped in `<Suspense>` at route level.

**Numeric inputs**: every numeric field uses `components/NumericInput.jsx`, never raw `<input type="number">` — the browser rejects a comma as a value character, silently truncating the decimal on a pt-BR keyboard. It renders `type="text" inputMode="decimal"` (or `inputMode="numeric"` with the `integer` prop), accepts both `,` and `.` regardless of app language, displays the separator matching the user's locale, and always emits a canonical `.`-decimal string via `onChange`. Because it renders as text, `min`/`step` no longer constrain input client-side — range validation is enforced server-side by the services (`typeof === 'number'` checks in `lib/services/*.service.js`).

**PWA**: dev uses Turbopack, prod uses Webpack (`next build --webpack`). PWA assets (`public/sw.js`, `.map` files) generated at build time, gitignored — not committed. `components/PWAUpdater.jsx` reloads on `controllerchange` (with a timeout fallback in case the `SKIP_WAITING` message is dropped) rather than reloading synchronously after posting it — a synchronous reload can tear the page down before the message reaches the waiting worker, leaving it stuck and the update toast reappearing on every later deploy. In dev, `PWAUpdater` instead unregisters any existing service worker and clears caches — Serwist is disabled in dev and `public/sw.js` isn't built, but a worker registered by an earlier `npm run build && npm start` on the same origin outlives that build and intercepts fetches (breaking cross-origin requests like the Google Fonts stylesheet).

## API

Swagger UI: `GET /api-docs`. Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <token>` → `req.user = { id, username }`.

| Prefix           | Auth | Endpoints                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------- | ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/api/auth`      | No   | `POST /register`, `/login`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password`, `/google`                                                           |
| `/api/auth`      | Yes  | `PATCH /currency`, `/language`, `/odometer`, `/password`; `POST/DELETE /google/link`; `GET /providers`; `DELETE /me`; `GET /me/export` |
| `/api/expenses`  | Yes  | CRUD + `GET /summary?year=&month=&category=`                                                                                           |
| `/api/reminders` | Yes  | CRUD + `POST /:id/complete`, `GET /badge-count`                                                                                        |
| `/api/health`    | No   | `GET /`                                                                                                                                |

## Tests

**Backend unit** (`test/unit/`): Node test runner + `node:assert`. Each file boots in-memory Mongo via `test/helpers/mongo.js` (`startMongo/stopMongo/resetMongo`). `lib/db.mjs`'s `connectDB()` reuses that connection (checks `mongoose.connection.readyState` before dialing `MONGODB_URI`, which is unset in this suite) — needed because `withAuth` now calls `connectDB()` itself; a test exercising `withAuth` directly still needs `startMongo()`/`resetMongo()` like any other Mongo-backed unit test (see `test/unit/middleware/auth.middleware.test.js`).

**Frontend unit** (`test/frontend/`): Vitest + Testing Library. Global mocks in `test/frontend/setup.tsx` (next/navigation, next/link). Per-file patterns:

```js
vi.mock('react-i18next', () => ({ useTranslation: () => ({ t: (k) => k }) }));
vi.mock('@/i18n/index.js', () => ({
  default: { t: (k) => k, changeLanguage: vi.fn(), language: 'en' },
}));
// service-layer tests replace global.fetch directly
global.fetch = vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({ ok: true, status: 200, json: async () => ({}) });
// JWT fixture
const makeToken = (payload) => `h.${btoa(JSON.stringify(payload))}.s`;
```

Add `vi.mock('@/i18n/index.js', ...)` in any file that imports a component using i18n transitively — the real module calls `initReactI18next` which fails. Chart components (`StackedMonthlyBar`, `MonthlyTrendChart`, `CategoryDonut`) are stubbed as no-ops in page tests.

**Integration** (`test/integration/`): real service↔model calls, in-memory Mongo, no HTTP. Files named `<flow>.flow.test.js`.

**API** (`test/api/`): Mocha + Chai + Supertest. Requires live server + Atlas. Root hook in `test/api/hooks/auth.js` registers a primary user once.

**E2E** (`e2e/`): Playwright Page Object Model. `globalTeardown` deletes all `/@test\.com$/` users from Atlas after each run.

E2E language gotcha: new users default to `pt-BR` via JWT. Always set `localStorage.setItem('i18nextLng', 'en')` in `addInitScript` for text-based assertions. POMs must use language-agnostic selectors (`button[type="submit"]`, CSS classes, `[name="..."]`) — never hard-code translated strings.

Password fixture gotcha: any password sent through `register`/`changePassword`/`resetPassword` must clear `passwordPolicy.assertStrongPassword()` — zxcvbn score ≥2 **and** not in the HaveIBeenPwned breach corpus. `test:unit`/`test:integration` stub `global.fetch` (see `test/helpers/email-mock.js`) so the breach check is a no-op there, but `test:api`/`test:e2e` hit the real HIBP endpoint — common-looking passwords like `Password123` or `NewPass99` are actually breached and get silently rejected (400), not just weak-scored. Use a genuinely random string (e.g. `Zx7Qw2vNp9Lm4Rk8`).

## Linting & Formatting

ESLint 9 flat config (`eslint.config.mjs`) — `eslint-config-next` + `eslint-config-prettier`. Prettier at `.prettierrc.json`.

Non-obvious rule decisions:

- `@next/next/no-page-custom-font` off for `app/**` — rule targets Pages Router `_document.js` only
- `no-unused-vars` off for `*.ts`/`*.tsx` — TypeScript handles it; constructor parameter properties falsely flagged
- `react-hooks/set-state-in-effect` false-positives on async functions in effects — suppressed per-line with comment; `AuthContext` localStorage init suppressed (SSR-safe only in `useEffect`)
- `frontend/**` excluded — legacy build artifacts

## CI Pipeline

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` — push/PR to `main`:

| `audit`            | —                  | `npm audit --audit-level=high --omit=dev`              |
| `test-unit`        | —                  | Node test runner + mongodb-memory-server               |
| `test-integration` | `test-unit`        | In-memory Mongo, no secrets                            |
| `test-api`         | `test-integration` | Mocha against `next build && next start`               |
| `e2e`              | `test-api`         | Playwright Chromium against `next build && next start` |

`test-api` and `e2e` require `JWT_SECRET` + `MONGODB_URI` GitHub Secrets. Dependabot: weekly npm + github-actions updates (`.github/dependabot.yml`).
